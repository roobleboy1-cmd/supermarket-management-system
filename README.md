# Single Supermarket Management System — Frontend

A modern, enterprise-grade, high-performance Single Supermarket Management System frontend built with **React.js**, **Vite**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, **TanStack Query**, **Zustand**, and **IndexedDB**.

This system is strictly architected for **one physical supermarket**. It does not implement branches, branch selectors, or multi-branch transfers — all 20 modules operate cohesively on the same single store's merchandise and cash drawer.

## 🔐 Authentication & Password Recovery Workflow

- **Staff Login** (`/login`): Secure portal with email & password, remember session, and convenient 1-click role switcher demo buttons.
- **Forgot Password** (`/forgot-password`): Staff email input with format validation, submission cooldown prevention, and generic security status messaging.
- **Reset Password** (`/reset-password`): Captures `?token=...` safely from query parameters, clears the token from the visible URL history, validates password complexity (min 8 chars, uppercase, number, matching confirm), and redirects to login upon success.

## 📶 Offline POS & PWA Architecture

When disconnected from the network:
1. The application shell and catalog remain fully usable.
2. Checkout transactions are saved into **IndexedDB** (`supermarket_pos_offline_db`) with unique UUID idempotency keys.
3. An **Offline Indicator** pill appears in the top navigation showing the count of queued transactions.
4. When internet connectivity returns, the background sync engine transmits queued transactions safely, reconciling stock changes without duplicate charges.
5. Pending transactions are clearly labeled as `pending` or `queued` and never falsely reported as verified bank payments.

## 🖨️ Thermal Receipt Printing

- **80 mm & 58 mm Toggle**: Select preferred thermal paper roll width in print preview dialog or store settings.
- **Browser Print Engine**: Clean `@media print` formatting ensures only the thermal receipt prints without browser header/footer margins.
- **Barcodes**: Integrated Code128 generation with price and item details for shelf labeling.
